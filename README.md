# Reducer Logic Exercises

Hello there student! I know that learning to write pure functions to transform state can be a little challenging. So I'm making this repo with exercises and solutions so you can practice some more.

## Solutions

Each exercise comes with a set of solutions. They are put on a branch. You can see these solutions in 2 ways:

- Look at the files on github (use the links below)
- Checkout the branches locally (make sure to commit your own changes before you do so)

## Links to solutions

- [User reducer solutions](https://github.com/Reinoptland/reducer-logic-exercises/blob/user-reducer-solutions/userReducer.js)
- [User reducer solutions on git history](https://github.githistory.xyz/Reinoptland/reducer-logic-exercises/blob/user-reducer-solutions/userReducer.js)

## How to use

1. Make a folder
2. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Reinoptland/reducer-logic-exercises.git
```

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run the tests

All of tests (a little overwhelming maybe)

```bash
npm test
```

Run only a specific test by passing -- aTestFileName.spec.js

```bash
npm test -- userReducer.spec.js
```

Run in specific test in watch mode (runs the test again when you edit any code)

```bash
npm run test-watch -- userReducer.spec.js
```
